## Description

**RankSEG** based methods are *plug-and-play* modules to improve segmentation results during **segmentation inference** (prediction) for trained segmentation models.

RankSEG-based methods are theoretically-grounded segmentation methods that are consistent with respect to the **Dice/IoU metrics**. They provide *almost guaranteed* improved performance over traditional thresholding or argmax segmentation methods.


## Installation

The easiest way to install `rankseg` is using `pip`:

```bash
pip install rankseg
```

## To-do List

- [ ] rankseg
